In this project, we use Chest X-Rays images to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of the disease. These images are used to train two deep networks, the Convolution Neural Network (CNN), and the Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) which is an artificial Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The proposed study involves three phases. First, the CNN model is trained on raw CXR images. Next, it is trained on pre-processed CXR images and finally enhanced CXR images are used for deep network CNN training. Geometric transformations, color transformations, image enhancement, and noise injection techniques are used for augmentation. From augmentation, we get 3,220 augmented CXRs as training datasets. In the final phase, CNN is used to extract the features of CXR imagery that are fed to the LSTM model. The performance of the four trained models is evaluated by the evaluation techniques of different models, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, false-positive rate, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
